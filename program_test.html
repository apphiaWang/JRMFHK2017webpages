							<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>The central goal of compressed sensing is to capture attributes of a signal using very few measurements. In most work to date this broader objective is exemplified by the important special case of classification or reconstruction from a small number of linear measurements. In the first part of this talk we use wireless information theory to derive fundamental limits on compressive classification, on the maximum number of classes that can be discriminated with low probability of error and on the tradeoff between the number of classes and the probability of misclassification. In the second part we describe how to use information theory to guide the design of linear measurements by maximizing mutual information between the measurements and the statistics of the source.</p>

							<p class="lead"><strong>Topic: </strong>A Beginner's Guide to Lattice Coding</p>
							<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Lattice codes may be viewed as linear codes designed for use over Gaussian-noise channels, and more generally, channels with real-valued input and output alphabets. It is by now well-established that lattice codes can achieve the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Lattice coding schemes also provide the best-known achievable rates in many multi-user communication settings. They form the basis of the compute-and-forward strategy that lies at the heart of physical-layer (wireless) network coding. Beyond reliability of communication, lattice-based coding schemes have also been proposed for information-theoretically secure communication. </p>
							<p>Lattice codes stand today where algebraic codes were about 25 years back. They have been shown to be theoretically capable of providing the best rates for reliable (and secure) communication in many AWGN settings, but they have struggled to fulfill their potential in practice. The main stumbling block has been finding low-complexity implementations of encoders and decoders for lattice codes in high dimensions. </p>
							<p>In this tutorial, we will give an overview of the theory and applications of lattice codes. We will begin with the necessary mathematical definitions and background for lattices. The earliest application of lattices in the information-theoretic context is in vector quantization, which we will briefly describe. The main focus of the tutorial will be on AWGN channel coding and physical-layer network coding applications, but time permitting, we will also touch upon other multi-user communication applications. We will provide a survey of the approaches being used to make lattice coding practical, and list some of the open research problems in this field.</p>

							<p class="lead"><strong>Topic: </strong>Second-order asymptotics in information theory</p>
							<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this tutorial, we present a unified treatment of single- and multi-user problems in Shannon’s information theory where we depart from the requirement that the error probability decays asymptotically in the blocklength. Instead, the error probabilities for various problems are bounded above by non-vanishing constants and the spotlight is shone on achievable coding rates as functions of the growing blocklengths. This represents the study of asymptotic estimates with non-vanishing error probabilities. In particular, we focus on the so-called second-order coding rates which approximately quantify the backoff from the first-order fundamental limit at finite blocklengths.</p>
							<p>We first discuss Strassen’s seminal result for binary hypothesis testing where the type-I error probability is non-vanishing and the rate of decay of the type-II error probability with growing number of independent observations is characterized. We subsequently use this basic hypothesis testing result to develop second-order asymptotic expansions for fixed-length lossless source and channel coding. Finally, we consider some network information theory problems for which the second-order asymptotics are known. These problems include some classes of channels with random state, the Slepian-Wolf problem and the some classes of the Gaussian interference channel.</p>
							<p>This tutorial is designed to be relatively self-contained. The student is expected to have some background in information theory at the level of Cover and Thomas to appreciate the material.</p>

							<p class="lead"><strong>Topic: </strong>Factor Graph Transforms</p>
							<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>Transforms of functions play an important role in many applications, be it for analysis purposes or for computational complexity reasons. For example, the Fourier Transform of a time function immediately tells us if that function is bandlimited or not. Or, Fast-Fourier-Transform-based techniques can be used to efficiently compute the convolution of two discrete-time functions.</p>
							<p>Given that factor graphs represent multivariate functions, it is not surprising that transforms play also an important role for factor graphs. In this presentation, we first present an example of a factor graph transform that helps in the analysis of the partition function of a factor graph. (Many important quantities, in particular w.r.t. the capacity of some channels, can be expressed as the partition function of a factor graph, and so a good understanding of this object and its approximations is a worthwhile endeavor.)</p>
							<p>Afterwards, we present an example of a factor graph transform that leads to an efficient implementation of the sum-product algorithm message update rules for certain function nodes. (The sum-product algorithm is at the basis of decoding algorithms for low-density parity-check codes, a class of codes which appears in various telecommunication standards, and so efficient implementations of the sum-product algorithm are highly desirable.)</p>
							<p>Where appropriate, we will point out connections of these factor graph transforms to gauge transforms in physics and to Valiant's holographic transforms in theoretical computer science.</p>
							<p>(The presentation is planned to be self-contained; basics of factor graphs will be introduced as needed.)</p>
